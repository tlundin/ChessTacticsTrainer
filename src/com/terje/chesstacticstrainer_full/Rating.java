/** 
 * The Rating class implements the Glicko Rating System, devised by Mark
 * Glickman to replace the Elo system that is currently used to rate chess
 * matches. 
 * <P>
 * The advantage of this system is that there is no ad-hoc "wild period" of
 * some number of games that it takes the player to become established. In
 * the Elo system this method is used to account for the need to quickly
 * get the players rating into the right ballpark, by allowing huge swings
 * before using the normal updating algorithm. Instead, the Glickman system
 * uses a Rating and a Rating Deviation, which may be thought of as similar
 * to a mean and a standard deviation in a normal distribution. Initially
 * the Rating is in the centre of the 0-3000 range, and the deviation is
 * quite high (350); as the player plays more and more games the rating and
 * the deviation settle down. Once the deviation is small the player is 
 * assured of having a reasonably accurate estimate of their strength in
 * the game.
 * <P>
 * Ratings adjustments are always based on a win-loss system. To simulate
 * a draw, it is necessary to adjust the ratings as though there was one
 * win and one loss, which is not currently supported by this code.
 * <P>
 * For details of how the rating system works, see 
 * <a href="http://math.bu.edu/INDIVIDUAL/mg/">
 * Mark Glickman's home page
 * </a>.
